    dct:abstract "We present an algorithm for computing a minimal set of generators for the ideal of a rational parametric projective curve in polynomial time. The method exploits the availability of polynomial algorithms for the computation of minimal generators of an ideal of points and is alternative to the existing Gröbner bases techniques for the implicitization of curves. The termination criterion is based on the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of a curve. The described computation yields also the Hilbert function and, hence, the Hilbert polynomial and the Poincaré series of the curves. Moreover, it can be applied to unions of rational curves. We have compared the implementation of our algorithm with the Hilbert driven elimination algorithm included in CoCoA 3.6 and Singular 1.2, obtaining, in general, significant improvements in timings.

    dct:abstract "Monomial representations and operations for Gröbner bases computations are investigated from an implementation point of view. The technique of vectorized monomial operations is introduced and it is shown how it expedites computations of Gröbner bases. Furthermore, a rank-based monomial representation and comparison technique is examined and it is concluded that this technique does not yield an additional speedup over vectorized comparisons. Extensive benchmark tests with the Computer Algebra System Singular are used to evaluate these concepts." ;

    dct:abstract "Several improvements to the computation of the minimal free resolution of finite modules have been made also recently, and some of them concerning ideals of polynomials are Hilbert driven or depend on the knowledge of the regularity of the ideal. Here I show that some of the calculations usually made to determine the minimal free resolution of a homogeneous polynomial ideal $I$ are still redundant, provided that we know a set of minimal homogeneous generators, the regularity, and the Hilbert function of $I$. More precisely, I show that the construction of some syzygies can be avoided. As result, the known methods for the computation of a minimal free resolution are improved. The underlying idea of this work can be also used to predict if certain points in generic position on general rational curves satisfy the minimal resolution conjecture. " ;
